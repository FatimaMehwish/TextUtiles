# Getting start with TextUtiles in react
This is my first react website namely "Text-Utiles"
This website is bootstraped through a link .
# Run
Run this website by writting 'npm run' or 'npm start' in terminal.
As a beginner I make a components in a src folder and add header component and TextForm component.

# Header Component
In a header there's a toggle button so user can view this page whether in dark theme or light theme 
how he wants.

# Text Fornm
1. First sectiton:
This text form contains a textarea which is a little more designed.
There's different buttons which can do onclick functions.  
    like
Convert to UpperCase button is use to convert all text into Upper Case.
Convert to LowerCase buttoon convert all written text in a Lower Case.
The Reverse Text button will reverse all text in the textarea.
There is a remove ExtraSpace button which removes all the unwanted spaces in text.
While clicking on Copy Text button the text in the textbox will be copied into the clipboard.
Clear Text button will Clear all the text present in the textbox.

2. Second section:
The second section will show the text summary .
How many words and characters the user is writing , He can view in this section.
Using my skills I put a logic through which a user can come to know how much time it will be taken to 
read his written text in textbox.
In another section user can preview his text.
